DX8 and DX9 MO2 profile for GAMMA. If you know what you're doing, just grab `modorder.txt` directly.

## Installation
1. Download the attached file [from the Releases tab](https://github.com/veerserif/gamma-dx8-and-dx9/releases)
2. **Close MO2!** This is very important otherwise you will have to redo these steps!
3. Extract it to `your GAMMA folder/profiles` (it should create a new folder called `G.A.M.M.A. DX8 and DX9 - 0.9.4`)
4. Open MO2
5.  Select the "GAMMA DX8 and DX9 - 0.9.4" mod profile. You should have **533** mods enabled by default.

## Troubleshooting

#### I have 0 mods in my profile!
This is almost ALWAYS caused by not closing MO2 before you do the other steps. Fix it by:
- In MO2, select another profile (e.g. the default `G.A.M.M.A.` profile)
- **CLOSE MO2 COMPLETELY.**
- Do step 3 of the installation steps again, overwrite files when prompted
- Open MO2 again, select the "GAMMA DX8 and DX9 - 0.9.4" mod profile.
